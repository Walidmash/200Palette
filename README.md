## RGB? HSL? What is it?!
> The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.
> HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.

**So** to get our 8 color gradients, we edit the lightness value between 0-100%, so we get the selected color from the user then we make some calculations on it in order to get the gradients.
```
 The R,G,B values are divided by 255 to change the range from 0..255 to 0..1:
R' = R/255
G' = G/255
B' = B/255
Cmax = max(R', G', B')
Cmin = min(R', G', B')
Î” = Cmax - Cmin
```

and then we edit the lightness by this equation:
```
 L = (Cmax + Cmin) / 2
```

## So what's about SVG?
**S**calable **V**ector **G**raphics is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.
